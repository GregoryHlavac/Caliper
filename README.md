# Caliper
=========

Caliper is an endpoint server for handling crash reports generated by [Google Breakpad] it is intended as a smaller scale alternative for projects that do not need the immense scale of [Socorro].

WARNING!
----
This is highly experimental right now as this is my first foray into node and things of that likeness, it will eventually get done but it is likely things will change drastically as it gets done, download it if you want to screw around but it doesn't do anything but accept POST'd crash dumps yet.
