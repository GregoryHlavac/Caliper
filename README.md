# Caliper
=========

Caliper is an endpoint server for handling crash reports generated by [Google Breakpad] it is intended as a smaller scale alternative for projects that do not need the immense scale of [Socorro] or its multiple application capabilities (although don't discount this as being entirely ruled out, if I need it in the future I will add it to caliper).

WARNING!
----
This is highly experimental right now as this is my first foray into node and things of that likeness, it will eventually get done but it is likely things will change drastically as it gets done, download it if you want to screw around but it doesn't do anything but accept POST'd crash dumps yet.
